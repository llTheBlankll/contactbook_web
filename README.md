# contactbook_web
Contact Book website version.


### This is the website version of Contact Book python
address book or a name and address book is a book or a database used for storing entries called contacts.
Each contact entry usually consists of a few standard fields (for example: first name, last name, company name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, fax number, mobile phone number).


### Notes
The 'Settings' at user icon and the 'Clear all contacts' in 'Contacts' Dropdown is not yet finished in directory /dashboard because I do not have enough time.
